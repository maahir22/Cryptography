# Cryptography
A fully functional website that allows users to perform various functions of Encryption and Decryption using various algorithms.

Initial Milestones :
1) Integrating an OTP System that uses HMAC-SHA1 algorithm with timeout based refresh system along with support from Backend Servers.
2) Demonstration of Why a 4 Digit OTP System will fail within the 10 Minute timeframe, since 4 Digit Based Numeric OTP's can be bruteforced and broken into.

Updates :
1) Added Basic XOR Encryption Technique via Random Private Key Generation.
2) Added a counter Decryption Technique.
3) Used BootStrap for formatting and styling the website.
4) Added Hashing Algorithm
5) Implemented RSA Algorithm from Scratch with increased Randomisation and PreComputed Prime Numbers/Euclid's Algorithm for GCD/Modular Exponentiation for instant      response.
